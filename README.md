Problems
Create a Parade class in a separate file called "Parade.java" where every instance has a name, an origin year, number of members, city, date and start time (LocalDateTime), a start street, and an end street. If a parade starts or ends at an intersection, set the start or end street to one of the streets at the intersection. Choose 10 or more parades from the above link, create an instance for each of them, and place them into an ArrayList<Parade> P. You can do this with a file or as literals in the driver.
